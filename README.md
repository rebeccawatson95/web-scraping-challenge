# web-scraping-challenge

In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. I was able to successfully scrape the data in Python and am still working on getting the data over to the HTML page. I will be continuing to work on this project as it has been the most difficult for me.
